Welcome to the most ~perfect~ slightly-less-buggy-than-yesterday code repository on GitHub! 
Warning: Side effects of diving deep into this codebase include sudden bursts of admiration, occasional chuckles, and a strong desire to ⭐️ the repo.

Remember, it’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. 😜
Happy coding! 🚀
